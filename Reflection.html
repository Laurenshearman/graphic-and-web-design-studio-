        <h2>Reflection</h1>
        <h3> In this module we have learnt alot of new things that i wanted to get into before starting uni with things like adobe InDesign and Illustrator to create posters and designs to put into my webiste.
            i thoroughly enjoyed this part of the module as it allowed me to show my creative side within one peice of work as i did eight typograghy posters and three hot air balloon posters both on different softwares.
            Aswell as this we used github and visual studio code which i have never used before so was very interesting leanring new things inside these to create a webiste.</p> 
        </h3>

        <h4>For this module i first completed all my typogrpahy posters to add into my website as there was a total of eight and wasn't sure of how to use Illustrator properly so i wanted to take time on that to get them to their best standard. 
            I got inspiration off the interent for majority of my typographys as i hadn't seen different types of systems before and then from that i created my own look on them all. I found this task most entertaining as it let me put my cretaivity into multiple peices of work with a common theme throughout with white, blue and black. 
            After i completed all my Typography posters i exported them as .PNG so we can include them into the webiste and allows them to be seen in the corret resolution. I spaced them out evenly on the page so it was three, three then two with evevnly spaced padding around them all. 
            Once i completed these tasks i moved onto my hot air balloon posters on InDesign. I have never used InDesign before starting university so was interesting learning how to use it as i have used photoshop before which was kind of similar. I went with a common theme of simplicity and white and another colour. On each poster i took out the background
            colour and made it transparent so it fits in with each poster and adds repetion to them all. At first i found inDesign hard to use as the way you move images around on it and edit them is alot different to photoshop. But in the end i got the hang of things as completed all three and exported them as .PNG as well so i can add into my website. I spaced the three posters evenly on the page so the text underneath moves with the posters when expanded or made smaller on a page. Last but not least i added in my HTML worksheets which show how i did work before i started my actual website as 
            the sheets demonstrated how to do the basics of a webiste so i used those alot to get help and figure certain things out such as; links, padding, images etc. I linked one of my images to github so you can see the progress i made on the sheets, although i had issues linking to my code and thr actual webistes so i just put in the screenshots to show proof i've done them.

         </h4>

         <h5> Overall i think my website went to plan with how i wanted it to. Eventhough i know i could have made it moe complicated and add more things inside it to make it more complex i think i met the inital standards of a webiste and added everything in i needed. i really enjoyed this module and have definetley disovered new skills i will use in the future. .</h5>
