            <div class="image_text">This is my first poster that i created on indesign. with my first poster i made
                i wanted to make it simplistic and easy to look at so i kept with a plain backgorund of hot airballoons to show to the audience 
            what we are promoting wihtout having to say alot. 
            i kept with the colour scheme of blue and white and with this i took the background colour off the logos to make it transparent. </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <img src="images/carp2.png" class="posterImages">
              <div class="image_text">For my second poster i changed up the theme and went with the colour scheme of orange and did a gradient background,
                 and changed the opacity of the images to make them fade in and out. Also i kept with the theme of
                  logos having a transparent background to keeo it a white colour scheme throughout all. </div>
          </div>
          <div>
            <img src="images/carp3.png" class="posterImages">
              <div class="image_text"> For the last poster i created i did a blue theme with a low opacity to see an image behind it in a blue fade. I put a blue background underneath the hot airballoon image and then changed the opacity on the image to fade in with the background.
                i added lines to this poster to add some shape for the logos and title to split apart text and images.
                for each one i created a white border for each one so they fit in line with each other and look similar even if that have different themes. </div>
